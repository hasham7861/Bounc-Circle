# BouncingCircle
##Description:
A casual game with the name bouncing circle which tests your ability in gaming. It’s not just your typical casual game, where it is easy to gain points. No! No! No! It’s just the opposite!

###Contributors:
I (Hasham), am the sole author of this game, i.e. the assets, the level creation, and the scripts are all my work. 

###Inspiration:
The real reason for the creation of this game was when I was really into playing indie/casual games back in 2015, and I just wanted to create one on my own. 

###Features:
The first feature is the level creation will be done dynamically. Secondly, you can gain points when the player circle bounces on top of the rainbow food circle. And finally, there is a menu system which allows the user to replay or quit the game quickly. 

###Skills Acquired:  I learned a lot from my first game creation. I learned finite states when using menu systems, the use of physics in games and the dynamic production of objects in games. 

###Problems Faced: 
Since this was my first ever app, I had a tough time with the main feature which was creating the level and the generating the blocks dynamically when I first started coding it out. 

###Tools used: 
Photoshop for creating assets, Netbeans for IDE.
